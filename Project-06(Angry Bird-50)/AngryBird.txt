ANGRY BIRD(CS50G)

-->A game which is played with a bird(alien in here).And there are obstacles which covers the enemy aliens or our targetted alien.All we need to do is throw the player alien on the targetted alien.Once it collides with the targetted alien it dies.And the victory message shows up.And a new game starts.
Extra Addition:
Once the player throws the player alien  and if the player presses "space" button before it collides with anything then two extra aliens will be spawned which will be behaving exactly like the other aliens.And once the aliens stops moving then it repositioned in the place as one.The extra two gets removed.
