Game Name:PONG
This game is developed by Colton the lecturer of CS50G course.I have brought some update to the game.Like I have brought an AI player which helps the user to play alone.
And the AI is hard to beat in the game.
If the PONG ball goes outside the boundary then the user or the AI player gets point and the game goes in the serving mode again.
Here is the video for the game:
