#NOTE 
-->[This game was built by the 'COLTON OGDEN' lecturer of CS50G.I have brought some changes in here,which are given below]

Match3 is a game where a player needs to match 3 tiles.If it matches 3 tiles then he recieves points for these.And he also can go to the next level if he can fullfill the given points within the given times.
1.Time Addition:
If the player matches tiles he will reciece +1 second for each tile.And this is how the time is added.
2.Flat Block:
The game starts from level-1.And in level 1 there is only flat blocks.The more level the player passes the more he will get variety tiles.
3.Shiny Block:
There are blocks which are different then the others.And it is shiny in color.Its special power is if the player can match 3 shiny blocks atleast then the entire row or column will be destroyed based on their position.
4.Swap:
It only swap when there is a match.If no matches then there will be no swap.
5.Resetting the Board:
In case if there is no any tile to match or swap the board will get resetted.
6.Play using mouse:
You can play the game using keyboard.But you can use mouse too.It will help you a lot while playing.
There is also a shiny blocks which helps the players to earn more points by destroying an entire column and row.But the player will have to match the shiny blocks ,so it is also a matter of luck.As it will appear randomly.
Once the plater move to next level the player will have different variation of tiles.To have more fun.And different variety tiles is having different value.
