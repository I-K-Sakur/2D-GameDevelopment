Super 50 bros:
A game where a player have to face difficulties like open place,pillar,no ground,some jump blocks and snails(touching it will kill the player).
There are some benefits too.If the player jump on snail then it will kill the snail and get the point.And also there is gems if the player collides with the actual jump block then it appears.It is based on the luck.So colliding or consuming it will give the player points.
There are also key and lock block.Consuming the key block will enable the lock block to disappear.If the player have already consumed the key block then it will be able to disappear the lock block.
The disappearance of the locked block will bring a goal post or pole-flag at the end of the level.So colliding with it will help the player to move into the next level.
